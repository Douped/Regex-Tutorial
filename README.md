# Regex Tutorial

Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore various components of regular expressions (regex) and provide detailed explanations for each component. Regular expressions are powerful patterns used to match and manipulate text. Understanding regex can greatly enhance your text processing and search capabilities.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will cover the following regex concepts:

**[Anchors](#anchors)**: Anchors specify the position of a pattern in the text.

**[Quantifiers](#quantifiers)**: Quantifiers define the number of occurrences of a pattern.

**[OR Operator](#or-operator)**: The OR operator allows for matching alternative patterns.

**[Character Classes](#character-classes)**: Character classes define sets of characters to match.

**[Flags](#flags)**: Flags modify the behavior of the regex matching process.

**[Grouping and Capturing](#grouping-and-capturing)**: Grouping and capturing enable the extraction of specific parts of a match.

**[Bracket Expressions](#bracket-expressions)**: Bracket expressions define custom character ranges.

**[Greedy and Lazy Match](#greedy-and-lazy-match)**: Greedy and lazy quantifiers control the greediness of pattern matching.

**[Boundaries](#boundaries)**: Boundaries define specific positions in the text.

**[Back-references](#back-references)**: Back-references match previously captured groups.

**[Look-ahead and Look-behind](#look-ahead-and-look-behind)**: Look-ahead and look-behind assertions enable conditional matching.

Each section will provide a detailed explanation of the corresponding regex component and its usage.
